## STEM Cooling System Project
Team Number: 303

Team Members: Cade Clonts, Jahmel Garduno, Daniel Resnick

Preparation Date: May 5th, 2025

Semester and Year: Spring 2025

University: Arizona State University

Professor: K. Nichols

## Team Role

My role in the team will be to develop the fan system for the cooling system. This wil act as a simulation of a cooling system that will teach K-12 students how a fan may work in a computer or other type of electrical system. I will be using the PIC microcontroller to control a fan through a h bridge using SPI.
