## STEM Weather Station Project
Team Number: 303

Team Members: Cade Clonts, Tyler Dean, Jahmel Garduno, Daniel Resnick

Preparation Date: Febuary 21, 2025

Semester and Year: Spring 2025

University: Arizona State University

Professor: K. Nichols

## Team Role

My role in the team will be to develop the fan system for the weather station. This wil act as a simulation of a cooling system that will teach K-12 students how 
weather forcasters are able to take data from sensors to display accurate readings to predict the weather. I will be using the PIC microcontroller to controll a fan through a h bridge and op amp.
