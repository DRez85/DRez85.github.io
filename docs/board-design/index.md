# Board Design
__The schematic below details the acuator subsystem to control a fan through an H bridge. This design incorporates several key sections, to ensure that the fan subsystem works seemlessly with the other subsystems. It has 2 debugging LEDs to show that the fan is on and the direction it is moving. There are also testpoints incorporated in the design to ensure that correct voltage is getting to the components and that everything is grounded properly. A 3.3V regulator is also included to make sure that proper power is supplied throughout the circuitry.
